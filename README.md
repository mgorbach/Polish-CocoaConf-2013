CocoaConf Boston 2013 Presentation: Spit and Polish
=====================

This is my presentation on "The Last 10%" from CocoaConf Boston 2013. Don't forget to look through the presenter notes, since they contain much of the actual presentation content.

There are both Keynote '08 and Keynote '13 formatted files here. There are also two PDFs included, which both have the presenter notes. Use the Highest Quality PDF if you are cloning the repository, but I also included a regular quality PDF because Github doesn't let you download files over 10 MB or so in raw form using the web interface.
